Project Description
My project is a web platform that helps users find wheelchair-accessible places in a chosen district. It includes a comment section for recommendations, displays previously suggested places, features an interactive chatbot for guidance, and integrates a map with geolocation to show nearby accessible landmarks.

The Problem statement
My project addresses the lack of accessibility information for individuals who use wheelchairs, helping them find accessible locations in a given area. By providing a platform with user-recommended places, an interactive map, and a chatbot assistant, I'm solving the problem of limited resources and uncertainty around accessible spaces, improving the independence and mobility of wheelchair users. It also encourages community-driven contributions to continuously update and expand the list of accessible places.

The Solution
I'm solving this problem by creating a comprehensive, user-friendly platform that offers several key features:
1.Wheelchair-Accessible Place Listings: Users can search and view a list of accessible locations within their chosen district, making it easier to find suitable places to visit.
2.User Recommendations: Your comment section allows users to suggest new accessible places, ensuring that the information stays up-to-date and relevant.
3.Interactive Chatbot: The chatbot guides users who may be unfamiliar with the website, making it easy to navigate and ensuring a smooth experience for all users.
4.Geolocation & Interactive Map: The interactive map uses the user’s geolocation to show nearby accessible places, allowing users to easily find landmarks or facilities that are wheelchair accessible around them.
5.By combining these features, you’re providing a dynamic and inclusive solution that helps wheelchair users navigate public spaces with ease, fostering a more accessible community.
